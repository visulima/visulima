                <h3>Storage duration</h3>
                <p>
                    Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose
                    for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your
                    data will be deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention
                    periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.
                </p>

                <h3>General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this website</h3>
                <p>
                    If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if special
                    categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third
                    countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49 (1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to
                    information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on &sect; 25 (1) TDDDG. The
                    consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual
                    measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, if your data is required for the fulfillment of a legal
                    obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our
                    legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the
                    following paragraphs of this privacy policy.
                </p>

                <h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
                <p>
                    In the scope of our business activities, we cooperate with various external parties. In some cases, this also requires the transfer of
                    personal data to these external parties. We only disclose personal data to external parties if this is required as part of the fulfillment
                    of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the
                    disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the disclosure of this data. When using processors, we only
                    disclose personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract on data processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint
                    processing agreement is concluded.
                </p>

                <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
                <p>
                    A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent
                    you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.
                </p>

                <h3>Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
                <p>
                    IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF
                    YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO
                    DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN
                    OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY
                    GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS THE
                    CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
                </p>
                <p>
                    IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
                    AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED
                    WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES
                    (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).
                </p>

                <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
                <p>
                    In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member
                    state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a
                    complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.
                </p>

                <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
                <p>
                    You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to
                    you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller,
                    this will be done only if it is technically feasible.
                </p>

                <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
                <p>
                    Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to demand information about your archived personal data, their
                    source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data at any time. You may also have a right to have your data
                    rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate
                    to contact us at any time.
                </p>

                <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
                <p>
                    You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may
                    contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the following cases:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim.
                        During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the
                        processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of this data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to
                        demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its eradication.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As
                        long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your
                        personal data.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data &ndash; with the exception of their archiving &ndash; may be
                    processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons
                    or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.

                <p>
                    For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the
                    website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether
                    the address line of the browser switches from &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the appearance of the lock icon in
                    the browser line.
                </p>
                <p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

                    Our websites and pages use what the industry refers to as &ldquo;cookies.&rdquo; Cookies are small data packages that do not cause any

                    on your device (permanent cookies). Session cookies are automatically deleted once you terminate your visit. Permanent cookies remain
                    archived on your device until you actively delete them, or they are automatically eradicated by your web browser.

                <p>
                    Cookies can be issued by us (first-party cookies) or by third-party companies (so-called third-party cookies). Third-party cookies enable

                    is cited. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the storage of required cookies to ensure the technically error-free and
                    optimized provision of the operator&rsquo;s services. If your consent to the storage of the cookies and similar recognition technologies has
                    been requested, the processing occurs exclusively on the basis of the consent obtained (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and &sect; 25 (1) TDDDG); this

                    evaluates various information (e.g., IP address, time spent on the website or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during
                    the analysis is forwarded to Cloudflare.
