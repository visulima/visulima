What makes @visulima/upload special:

âœ… Zero-config setup with sensible defaults
âœ… Automatic image optimization and transformation
âœ… Enterprise-grade security features
âœ… Comprehensive test coverage
âœ… Active maintenance and support

No more wrestling with upload libraries that only work in one framework!

### Post 3
Example usage with Hono (our favorite lightweight framework):

```typescript
import { Multipart, DiskStorage } from "@visulima/upload";

const storage = new DiskStorage({ directory: "./uploads" });
const multipart = new Multipart({ storage });

// That's it! Ready to handle uploads
```

Works the same way with Express, Fastify, or any Web API compatible framework.

### Post 4
Storage backends supported:
â€¢ AWS S3 (with presigned URLs)
â€¢ Google Cloud Storage
â€¢ Azure Blob Storage
â€¢ Vercel Blob
â€¢ Local filesystem

All with consistent APIs and automatic scaling capabilities.

### Post 5
Built for modern development:
â€¢ ESM & CommonJS support
â€¢ Tree-shakable imports
â€¢ Zero dependencies for core functionality
â€¢ Comprehensive TypeScript types
â€¢ Extensive documentation and examples

The release is coming very soon! Stay tuned for the full announcement. ðŸŽ‰
