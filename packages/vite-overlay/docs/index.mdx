# Enhanced Error Overlay for Vite

A powerful development tool that provides rich error displays with source mapping, cause chain navigation, and intelligent solutions for Vite applications.

## What is Vite Overlay?

Vite Overlay is a comprehensive error handling plugin for Vite that transforms the default error display into a rich, interactive debugging experience. It enhances error reporting with source maps, cause chain navigation, syntax highlighting, and AI-powered solution suggestions.

## Key Features

### Enhanced Error Display
Rich, interactive error overlays with syntax highlighting and code frames showing the exact location of errors in your source code.

### Source Map Integration
Shows original `.tsx`/`.ts` files instead of compiled paths, making it easier to debug TypeScript and JSX code.

### Cause Chain Navigation
Navigate through multi-level error chains with original source locations. When errors have causes, you can explore the entire error chain.

### Beautiful UI
Modern, accessible interface with automatic light/dark theme support based on system preferences.

### Intelligent Solutions
AI-powered error analysis provides suggested fixes and solutions for common errors, helping you resolve issues faster.

### Real-time Updates
Hot Module Replacement (HMR) integration provides instant error feedback as you develop.

### Framework Support
Built-in support for React, Vue, Svelte, and other popular frameworks with framework-specific error handling.

## Use Cases

### Development Debugging
Get immediate, detailed feedback on runtime errors, build errors, and import resolution failures during development.

### TypeScript Projects
Source map integration ensures you see errors in your original TypeScript files, not the compiled JavaScript.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Comprehensive support for SSR errors with enhanced stack traces and source mapping.

### Multi-Framework Projects
Automatically detects and adapts to React, Vue, Svelte, and other frameworks in your project.
