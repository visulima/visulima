## Features

## Installation

```sh
npm install @visulima/crud
```

```sh
yarn add @visulima/crud
```

```sh
pnpm add @visulima/crud
```

## Usage

This package has an extended version of the `@visulima/connect` package.
That means you can use all the features of the `@visulima/connect` package, in addition to the features of this package.

```ts
// pages/api/hello.js
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { createNodeRouter } from "@visulima/crud";
import cors from "cors";

// Default Req and Res are IncomingMessage and ServerResponse
// You may want to pass in NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse
const router = createNodeRouter<NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse>();

router
  .get((req, res) => {
    res.send("Hello world");
  });

export default router.nodeHandler();
```

## Supported Node.js Versions

Libraries in this ecosystem make the best effort to track
[Node.js’ release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule). Here’s [a
post on why we think this is important](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/maintainers-should-consider-following-node-js-release-schedule-ab08ed4de71a).
