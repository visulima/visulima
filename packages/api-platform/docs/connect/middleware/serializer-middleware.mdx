## Configuration

The middleware is configured by defining some `serializers`.

```
serializersMiddleware(
  [
    {
      regex: /^application\/xml$/,
      serializer: (data) => `<message>${data}</message>`,
    },
    {
      regex: /^application\/json$/,
      serializer: (data) => JSON.stringify(data)
    },
    {
      regex: /^text\/plain$/,
      serializer: (data) => data
    }
  ],
  'application/json'
)
```

The `defaultContentType` (optional) option is used if the request and handler don't specify what type is wanted.


## Serializer Functions

When a matching serializer is found, the `Content-Type` header is set and the serializer function is run.

The function is passed the entire `data` object, and should return a string.

If a string is returned, the `body` attribute of the response is updated.

If an object with a `body` attribute is returned, the entire response object is replaced. This is useful if you want to manipulate headers or add additional attributes in the Lambda response.


## Content Type Negotiation

The header is not the only way the middleware decides which serializer to execute.

The content type is determined in the following order:

 * The `Accept` header via [accept](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accept)
 * `defaultContentType` middleware option

All options allow for multiple types to be specified in your order of preference, and the first matching serializer will be executed.
