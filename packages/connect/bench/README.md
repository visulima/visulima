# Benchmarks

A simple benchmark against some popular router using [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk)

```
wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://localhost:3000/user/123
```

> Remember, this benchmark is for reference only and by no means says that one is better than the others. The slowest part of the application is still the application code itself, not the library.

## How-to

Set permissions:

```bash
chmod u+x ./run.sh
chmod u+x ./runall.sh
```

Run individual benchmark

```bash
./run <library>
# ./run connect
```

Run all benchmarks

```bash
./runall
```
