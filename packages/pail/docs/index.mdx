# Pail

**Highly configurable Logger for Node.js, Edge and Browser**

Pail is a powerful, flexible logging library built on top of modern JavaScript foundations. It provides a comprehensive logging solution with support for multiple log levels, custom types, processors, reporters, and advanced features like throttling, scoping, timers, and interactive terminal UIs.

## Why Pail?

- **Easy to use** - Simple API that feels natural
- **Hackable to the core** - Fully extensible with custom processors and reporters
- **Integrated timers** - Built-in performance timing utilities
- **Custom pluggable processors and reporters** - Extend functionality easily
- **TypeScript support** - Full type safety out of the box
- **Interactive and regular modes** - Support for progress bars, multi-progress bars, spinners, multi-spinners, and interactive manager
- **Object tree rendering** - Utility function to visualize objects as ASCII trees
- **Secrets & sensitive information filtering** - Built-in redaction support
- **Filename, date and timestamp support** - Rich metadata tracking
- **Scoped loggers and timers** - Organize logs by context
- **Scaled logging levels mechanism** - RFC 5424 compliant
- **String interpolation support** - Format messages like console.log
- **Object and error interpolation** - Rich error handling
- **Stack trace and pretty errors** - Beautiful error formatting
- **Simple and minimal syntax** - Intuitive API design
- **Spam prevention by throttling logs** - Avoid log flooding
- **Browser and Server support** - Universal logging solution
- **Redirect console and stdout/stderr** - Easy integration
- **Pretty or JSON output** - Multiple output formats
- **ESM-only with tree-shaking support** - Modern JavaScript (Node.js ≥ 20.19)
- **Supports circular structures** - Robust object serialization
- **Fast and powerful** - Optimized for performance

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { pail } from "@visulima/pail";

pail.success("Operation successful");
pail.debug("Hello", "from", "L59");
pail.pending("Write release notes for %s", "1.2.0");
pail.critical(new Error("Unable to acquire lock"));
pail.watch("Recursively watching build directory...");
pail.complete({
    prefix: "[task]",
    message: "Fix issue #59",
    suffix: "(@prisis)",
});
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install @visulima/pail
```

```bash
yarn add @visulima/pail
```

```bash
pnpm add @visulima/pail
```

## Core Concepts

Pail is built around three core concepts:

### Log Levels

Pail adheres to the log levels defined in [RFC 5424](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5424) extended with `trace` level. This means you can use log levels to filter out messages that are not important to you.

### Reporters

Reporters are responsible for writing log messages to various destinations (console, files, etc.). Pail comes with built-in reporters:

- `JsonReporter` - Structured JSON output
- `PrettyReporter` - Beautiful formatted console output
- `SimpleReporter` - Simple formatted output (server only)
- `FileReporter` - Write logs to rotating files (server only)

### Processors

Processors modify or enhance log metadata before it reaches reporters. Built-in processors include:

- `CallerProcessor` - Adds caller information (file, line, column)
- `RedactProcessor` - Redacts sensitive information
- `MessageFormatterProcessor` - Formats messages with string interpolation
- `ErrorProcessor` - Serializes errors with cause chains
