# Visulima upload

Store files in a web-accessible location via a simplified API. Can automatically scale and rotate images. Includes S3, Azure, GCS and local filesystem-based backends with the most convenient features of each.

## Features

- TypeScript ready
- Parent directories are created automatically as needed (like S3 and Azure)
- Content types are inferred from file extensions (like the filesystem)
- Files are by default marked as readable via the web (like a filesystem + web server)
- Images can be automatically scaled to multiple sizes
- Images can be cropped
- Images are automatically rotated if necessary for proper display on the web (i.e. iPhone photos with rotation hints are right side up)
- Image width, image height and correct file extension are made available to the developer
- Non-image files are also supported
- Web access to files can be disabled and re-enabled
- GIF is supported, including animation, with full support for scaling and cropping
- On fire about minimizing file sizes for your resized images? You can plug in `imagemin` and compatible tools using the `postprocessors` option.
