# Next.js Link

All relative Markdown links are automatically converted to Next.js links. This
means that the target page will be prefetched. And when you click on a link, the
page will be loaded on the client-side like a SPA, without making a full page
load. For example:

```md
Click [here](/about) to read more.
```

Will be equivalent to:

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link'

Click <Link href="/about">here</Link> to read more.
```

This feature makes navigation between Nextra pages fast and seamless.
