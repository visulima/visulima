# Next.js Image

The standard way to use
[Next.js Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization)
inside MDX is to directly import the component:

```mdx
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image src="/demo.png" alt="Hello" width={500} height={500} />
```

## Static Image

import { Callout } from '@visulima/nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout>
  This feature is enabled via `staticImage: true` in the Nextra config by
  default.
</Callout>

Nextra supports automatically optimizing your static image imports with the
Markdown syntax. You do not need to specify the width and height of the image,
just use the `![]()` Markdown syntax:

```md filename="index.mdx"
![Hello](/demo.png)
```

This loads the `demo.png` file inside the `public` folder, and automatically
wraps it with Next.js `<Image>`.

<Callout>
  You can also use `![](../public/demo.png)` to load the image from a relative
  path, if you don't want to host it via `public`.
</Callout>

With Next.js Image, there will be no layout shift, and a beautiful blurry
placeholder will be shown by default when loading the images:
