const textInput = `My name is Jessica Thompson, and I was born on May 12, 1988, in a small town called Oakdale. I grew up with my parents and two siblings, an older brother named Daniel and a younger sister named Emily. We lived in a cozy two-story house with a white picket fence. In high school, I was actively involved in the drama club and played the lead role in our school's production of "Romeo and Juliet." After graduation, I pursued my passion for writing and earned a Bachelor's degree in English Literature from the University of Cambridge in 2010. Currently, I work as a freelance writer, specializing in content creation for various online platforms.
