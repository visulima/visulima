Visulima Nextra Docs Theme is a theme that includes almost everything you need to build a modern documentation website. It includes a top navigation bar, a search bar, a pages sidebar, a TOC sidebar, and other [built-in components](/docs/nextra-theme-docs/writing-content/components).

This website itself is built with the Visulima Nextra Docs Theme.

## Start as New Project

<Steps>
### Install

To create a Nextra Docs site manually, you have to install **Next.js**, **React**, **Nextra**, and **Visulima Nextra Docs Theme**. In your project directory, run the following command to install the dependencies:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="pnpm">```bash pnpm i next react react-dom nextra @visulima/nextra-theme-docs ```</Tab>
    <Tab title="npm">```bash npm i next react react-dom nextra @visulima/nextra-theme-docs ```</Tab>
    <Tab title="yarn">```bash yarn add next react react-dom nextra @visulima/nextra-theme-docs ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout>If you already have Next.js installed in your project, you only need to install `nextra` and `@visulima/nextra-theme-docs` as the add-ons.</Callout>

### Add Next.js Config

Create the following `next.config.js` file in your project’s root directory:

```js filename="next.config.js"
const withNextra = require("nextra")({
    theme: "@visulima/nextra-theme-docs",
    themeConfig: "./theme.config.jsx",
});

module.exports = withNextra();

// If you have other Next.js configurations, you can pass them as the parameter:
// module.exports = withNextra({ /* other next.js config */ })
```

With the above configuration, Nextra can handle Markdown files in your Next.js project, with the specified theme. Other Nextra configurations can be found in [Guide](https://nextra.site/docs/guide).

### Create Docs Theme Config

Lastly, create the corresponding `theme.config.jsx` file in your project’s root directory. This will be used to configure the Visulima Nextra Docs theme:

```jsx filename="theme.config.jsx"
export default {
    logo: <span>My Nextra Documentation</span>,
    project: {
        link: "https://github.com/shuding/nextra",
    },
    // ... other theme options
};
```

Full theme configurations can be found [here](/docs/nextra-theme-docs/configuration/theme).

### Ready to Go!

Now, you can create your first MDX page as `pages/index.mdx`:

```mdx filename="pages/index.mdx"
# Welcome to Nextra

Hello, world!
```

<span className="flex gap-4">
    And run the `next` or `next dev` command specified in `package.json`to start developing the project! <PartyPopper size={24} className="mt-0.5" />
</span>

</Steps>
