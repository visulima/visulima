Features for allowing you to log to the console.

You can access these tools on the cerebro toolbox.

## clear

This clears the console window.

```js
toolbox.logger.clear()
```

## critical

Prints a critical message.

```js
toolbox.logger.critical("Your system does not have Yarn installed.")
```

## error

Prints an error message. Use this when something goes Pants-On-Head wrong. What does that mean?
Well, if your next line of code isn't `process.exit(0)`, then it was probably a warning.

```js
toolbox.logger.error('Out of disk space.')
```

## danger
@todo write doc

## success

Print a "something good just happened" message.

```js
toolbox.logger.success('We did it!')
```

## warning

Prints a warning message. Use this when you feel a disturbance in the force.

```js
toolbox.logger.warning("Your system does not have Yarn installed. It's awesome.")
```

## info

Prints an informational message. Use this as your goto.

```js
toolbox.logger.info('Hello. I am a chatty plugin.')
```

## debug

Only used for debugging your plugins. You can pass this function a string or an object.

```js
toolbox.logger.debug(someObject, 'download status')
```

The `message` parameter is object you would like to see.

The `label` is an optional label on a message which is handy if you've got a lot of debug messages, and
you're losing track of which one is which.

The `showIcon` shows an icon before the message and label.
