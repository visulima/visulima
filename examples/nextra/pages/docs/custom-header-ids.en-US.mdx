# Custom Header Ids

You can specify custom header ids using the format, `## Header [#custom-id]`.
For example:

```markdown
## Foo [#bar]
```

## This Has a Custom Id [#custom-id-example]

You can see the custom header id in the header above. Note both by hovering over
the header, as well as in the table of contents, the `custom-id-example` href is
in use.

## This Has No Custom Id

This header has no custom id. The id is generated from the header text.
