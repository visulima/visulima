# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Successfully implemented enhanced package.json file discovery with customizable search order and comprehensive test coverage.

## Recent Changes
1. **Modified file discovery order**: Changed default search order from `json → yaml → json5` to `yaml → json5 → json`
2. **Added custom file order option**: New `fileOrder` option allows users to specify custom search priority
3. **Enhanced type definitions**: Updated `ReadOptions` type to include `fileOrder?: ("json" | "yaml" | "json5")[]`
4. **Comprehensive test coverage**: Added extensive tests for mixed file scenarios and custom order functionality

## Implementation Details
- Created `buildSearchPatterns()` helper function to handle file order logic
- Updated both `findPackageJson` and `findPackageJsonSync` functions
- Added support for filtering disabled formats in custom file order
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing API

## Next Steps
- All requested features have been implemented and tested
- Ready for production use
- Consider updating documentation/examples to showcase new functionality
