## Objectives
- âœ… Initialize memory-bank system
- âœ… Set up project context tracking
- ðŸ”„ Document comprehensive project architecture
- ðŸ”„ Map package relationships and dependencies

## Project Understanding
1. Core Purpose:
   - Comprehensive TypeScript framework/platform
   - Focus on modern web development tools
   - Emphasis on developer experience

2. Key Features:
   - API development tools
   - Web framework utilities
   - Development toolchain
   - System utilities
   - Formatting and display tools

3. String Package Deep Dive:
   - Core Features:
     - Case transformations (20+ variants)
     - Locale-aware string processing
     - ANSI and emoji handling
     - Performance optimizations
     - String width calculation with Unicode support
   - Architecture:
     - Modular design with separate case handlers
     - Fast path for ASCII-only text
     - Extensible with custom acronyms
     - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Key Components:
     - `splitByCase`: Core string tokenization
     - Case-specific transformers (camel, pascal, etc.)
     - Utility functions for character analysis
     - Type definitions for string operations
     - `getStringWidth`: Unicode-aware string width calculator
       - Handles complex emoji sequences
       - Supports combining characters
       - ANSI escape code handling
       - Zero-width character support
       - Surrogate pair handling
     - `getStringTruncatedWidth`: Advanced width calculation
       - Comprehensive Unicode support
       - Script-specific combining marks handling:
         - Southeast Asian (Thai, Lao)
         - Indic (Devanagari, Bengali, Gurmukhi)
         - Arabic and Persian
         - Hebrew
         - Tibetan
         - Vietnamese
       - Variation selectors and diacritics
       - Modular code with dedicated character type detection

## Questions
1. Architecture:
   - What are the design principles guiding package separation?
   - How are breaking changes managed across packages?
   - What is the testing strategy across packages?

2. Development:
   - What is the contribution workflow?
   - How are dependencies managed between packages?
   - What is the release strategy?

3. Documentation:
   - What is the documentation coverage across packages?
   - How are API changes documented?
   - What examples exist for package integration?

## Blockers
- None identified yet

## Next Actions
1. Analyze package interdependencies
2. Review build and test configurations
3. Examine example applications
4. Document API patterns
