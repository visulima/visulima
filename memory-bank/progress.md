# Progress: Visulima

## What Works ✅

### Core Infrastructure
- Monorepo orchestration with Nx 21.5.2
- 30+ utility packages with consistent structure
- pnpm workspace setup and management
- Build pipeline with tsup
- Testing framework (Vitest) configured
- Linting and formatting (ESLint + Prettier)
- Type checking with TypeScript 5.9.3

### Development Workflow
- Pre-commit hooks with Husky
- Git commit linting
- Code generation templates (plop)
- Parallel task execution
- Intelligent caching system

### Documentation & Examples
- Storybook application
- Per-package READMEs
- API documentation framework
- Usage examples in examples/

### Quality Assurance
- Automated testing across all packages
- Type safety verification
- Code linting and formatting
- Secret detection (secretlint)
- Dependency audit (audit-ci)
